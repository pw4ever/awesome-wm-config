# Vicious

Vicious is a modular widget library for window managers, but mostly
catering to users of the *awesome* window manager. It was derived from
the old *Wicked* widget library, and has some of the old *Wicked* widget
types, a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new ones.

Vicious widget types are a framework for creating your own
widgets. Vicious contains modules that gather data about your system,
and a few *awesome* helper functions that make it easier to register
timers, suspend widgets and so on. Vicious doesn't depend on any third party
Lua libraries, but may depend on additional system utilities (see widget
description).
